This is a tailored version of Lua for use with Moai.

It has been adapted in the following ways:

- Use of localeconv has been removed from trydecpoint () in llex.c.
- All C standard file io functions have been replaced by zipfs equivalents.
- Initialization and cleanup of zipfs has been added to main () in lua.c and luac.c.
