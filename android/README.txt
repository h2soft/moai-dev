-To create an Android host, execute "make-host.sh" and pass it the package for your application. For example: bash make-host.sh com.getmoai.samples
-You will need to have the libmoai build working before "make-host.sh" will work. Check libmoai/README.txt for details.
-Once "make-host.sh" has executed successfully, it will create a "untitled-host" directory. This directory contains everything you need to run your Moai project on Android.
-The Android host uses a template project to dynamically generate a host for you when you run it. To edit this template, examine and edit the contents of untitled-host/host-source.
